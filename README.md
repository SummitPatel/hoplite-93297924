#SCSS
After setup, to continue using regular scss.liquid files, just import the corresponding .scss file in `application.scss`

```
@import "style.scss";
```

Then keep working in your `style.scss.liquid` file. This means that you now get full scss functionality in additon to existing liquid functionality!
